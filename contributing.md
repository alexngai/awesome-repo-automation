## Quality Standards

To be included, a project should meet these criteria:

- It must be related to git repository automation.
- It should be actively maintained (not archived or abandoned).
- It should have documentation or a README explaining what it does.
- If open source, it should have a reasonable number of stars or community adoption.

## Updating Your Pull Request
